jade-runtime
============

A slightly modified version of Jade's runtime.js that works in a browser environment. Used by
[Snowball](https://github.com/bengler/snowball) to provide a common require()'able Jade runtime *and* a place to register
global template variables and helpers.

Probably not usable for anything other than that.
